# Bootstrap Portifolio
## About the Project
A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.

An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. 
Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. 
This last point canâ€™t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies the requirements:
- Using Bootstrap solution to minimize use of media queries.
- A navigation menu at the top
- A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include
- A section displaying your work in grid
- Use Bootstrap cards for each project
- The description should give a brief overview of the work
- Each project will eventually link to your class project work!
- List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp
- All buttons on a footer section should display a box shadow upon hover.
